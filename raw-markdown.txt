# Welcome to Markdown Basics

## Introduction
This document demonstrates various Markdown formatting techniques that you can use in your own writing. Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy to read and write.

## Text Formatting

Plain text is written normally. You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also combine them for ***bold italic*** text. To add ~~strikethrough~~, use double tildes.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
* First item
  * Sub-item one
  * Sub-item two
* Second item
* Third item

### Ordered Lists

    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

## Blockquotes

> Multiple paragraphs can be included in a blockquote by adding a blank line with '>' between them.
