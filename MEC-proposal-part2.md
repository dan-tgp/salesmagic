### Project 3: Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center's website has untapped potential in converting visitor interest into tangible business outcomes. While the site attracts qualified traffic, opportunities exist to better align user journeys with conversion goals, whether that's generating leads, driving sales, or increasing dealer visits. By optimizing these conversion paths, we can maximize the return on all digital marketing investments and better serve visitor needs.

### Project 4: Local Dealers SEO Program

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center faces a significant opportunity in local search visibility across its dealer network. Currently, potential customers searching for marine services, boat parts, and maintenance in specific locations are not consistently finding YANMAR MEC's authorized dealers. While a dealer locator exists, the current structure lacks dedicated, SEO-optimized pages for individual dealer locations, limiting visibility in local search results. Additionally, varying levels of SEO implementation across dealer websites result in inconsistent market presence and missed opportunities to capture local search traffic.

**Solution:**
Trend Growth Partners will implement a comprehensive local SEO program that includes:

- Development of an enhanced dealer locator system with individual, optimized URLs for each location
- Creation of customized SEO optimization recommendations for the top 50 dealers
- Implementation of location-specific content strategies based on local keyword research
- Development of Google Business Profile optimization guidelines for dealer locations
- Strategic recommendations for dealer website improvements
- Creation of scalable templates and processes for future dealer expansion

Our approach will create a robust local search presence across the entire dealer network while prioritizing key markets and high-value locations.

**Keys to Success:**
- Prioritize markets and dealers based on comprehensive local keyword research
- Create SEO-friendly, conversion-optimized dealer landing pages
- Develop clear, actionable optimization guidelines for dealer implementation
- Ensure consistent brand messaging across all dealer locations
- Maintain scalability for future network expansion

**Implementation Time:**
We have budgeted 80 hours for the implementation of the enhanced dealer locator and optimization recommendations.

**Cost & Timeline:**
The cost of Project 4 is $79,200 and is expected to take approximately 5 months to complete.
