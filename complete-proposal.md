### Project 1: Website Technical SEO & Performance Audit

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center's digital success depends on establishing a robust technical foundation for its online presence. Currently, the website requires a comprehensive evaluation to ensure optimal visibility and performance in search engines. Without this foundation, even the most sophisticated SEO strategies may fall short of their potential. A thorough technical audit is essential to identify and address any barriers preventing Google from effectively discovering, crawling, and indexing the site's valuable content. Additionally, in today's mobile-first environment, page load performance directly impacts both search rankings and user engagement, making technical optimization crucial for competitive advantage.

**Solution:**
After analyzing the YANMAR Mastry Engine Center domain, Trend Growth Partners will conduct our Medium-level Technical SEO and Performance Audit, which examines 55+ of the most important technical and performance factors that impact search visibility and user experience. This carefully scoped audit includes:

- Deep analysis of crawling and indexation patterns using Google Search Console data
- Systematic site-wide crawls to identify technical optimization opportunities
- Implementation of Google's Core Web Vitals framework to assess and improve performance
- Detailed Lighthouse analysis for performance, accessibility, and best practices
- Strategic recommendations for improved content structure and technical SEO elements

This medium-complexity audit is specifically designed to address the most impactful technical factors while maintaining cost-effectiveness. Our methodology ensures thorough examination of all crucial technical aspects affecting search performance and user experience.

**Keys to Success:**

### Project 2: SEO Content Optimization & Creation

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center's website content currently lacks strategic alignment with proven search demand in the marine engine market. While the existing content serves informational purposes, it has not been optimized to capture high-value organic search traffic. Our analysis indicates significant missed opportunities in search visibility, with competitors currently dominating search results for crucial industry terms and product-related queries. Without a data-driven keyword strategy and SEO-optimized content, YANMAR Mastry Engine Center is missing opportunities to connect with potential customers at critical stages of their purchase journey.

**Solution:**
Trend Growth Partners will implement a comprehensive content optimization strategy that includes:

- In-depth keyword research using Ahrefs' industry-leading database to identify high-value search opportunities

### Project 3: Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center's website has untapped potential in converting visitor interest into tangible business outcomes. While the site attracts qualified traffic, opportunities exist to better align user journeys with conversion goals, whether that's generating leads, driving sales, or increasing dealer visits. By optimizing these conversion paths, we can maximize the return on all digital marketing investments and better serve visitor needs.

### Project 4: Local Dealers SEO Program

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center faces a significant opportunity in local search visibility across its dealer network. Currently, potential customers searching for marine services, boat parts, and maintenance in specific locations are not consistently finding YANMAR MEC's authorized dealers. While a dealer locator exists, the current structure lacks dedicated, SEO-optimized pages for individual dealer locations, limiting visibility in local search results. Additionally, varying levels of SEO implementation across dealer websites result in inconsistent market presence and missed opportunities to capture local search traffic.

**Solution:**
Trend Growth Partners will implement a comprehensive local SEO program that includes:

- Development of an enhanced dealer locator system with individual, optimized URLs for each location
- Creation of customized SEO optimization recommendations for the top 50 dealers
- Implementation of location-specific content strategies based on local keyword research

Our approach will create a robust local search presence across the entire dealer network while prioritizing key markets and high-value locations.

**Keys to Success:**
- Prioritize markets and dealers based on comprehensive local keyword research
- Create SEO-friendly, conversion-optimized dealer landing pages
- Develop clear, actionable optimization guidelines for dealer implementation
- Ensure consistent brand messaging across all dealer locations
- Maintain scalability for future network expansion

**Implementation Time:**
We have budgeted 80 hours for the implementation of the enhanced dealer locator and optimization recommendations.

**Cost & Timeline:**
The cost of Project 4 is $79,200 and is expected to take approximately 5 months to complete.

**Expected Completion Date:**
This project is expected to be completed by November 1, 2025.

**Project Complete When:**
1. Enhanced dealer locator with individual location pages has been implemented
2. SEO optimization recommendations have been delivered for top 50 dealers

- Assistance in identifying and prioritizing top 50 dealers
- Support in distributing optimization recommendations to dealer contacts
- Communication channels to dealer network
- Relevant dealer program assets and guidelines
- Input on dealer network priorities and strategic markets

### Project 5: Create The Marine Resource Center

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center currently captures only a fraction of the potential organic search traffic from marine enthusiasts and professionals. A vast array of marine-related informational searches represent untapped opportunities to connect with potential customers earlier in their journey. Without comprehensive, searchable content addressing these queries, MEC is missing chances to establish brand authority and capture market mindshare.

**Solution:**
Trend Growth Partners will create a comprehensive Marine Resource Center through:

- Extensive keyword research to identify high-value informational queries
- Development of a scalable content production framework using advanced AI technology
- Creation and publication of 500 optimized articles covering key marine topics
- Implementation of user-friendly navigation and content organization

This approach enables rapid scaling of valuable content while maintaining quality and relevance.

- Execute comprehensive keyword research aligned with target audience needs
- Implement rigorous quality control in AI content production
- Create intuitive content organization and navigation systems
- Maintain consistent SEO optimization across all articles
- Design engaging, user-friendly page templates
- Establish scalable content production and publishing workflows

**Cost & Timeline:**
The cost of Project 5 is $35,300 and is expected to take approximately 8 months to complete.

**Expected Completion Date:**
This project is expected to be completed by October 1, 2025.

**Project Complete When:**
1. Comprehensive keyword research has been completed and approved
2. Content templates and production workflows have been established

### Project 6: Digital PR Campaigns

**Problem:**
YANMAR Mastry Engine Center's website currently has a Domain Rating (DR) of 36, indicating significant room for improvement in domain authority. This lower DR limits the site's ability to compete effectively in search rankings. As search algorithms and AI models increasingly rely on authoritative citations to determine content quality and brand relevance, building a strong backlink profile becomes crucial for both immediate SEO success and future digital presence.

**Solution:**
Trend Growth Partners will implement a dual-approach Digital PR strategy:

**Data Insights Reports:**
- Creation of 2 comprehensive, data-driven industry reports

- Create compelling, data-driven content that demands attention
- Develop engaging, shareable data visualizations
- Maintain detailed tracking of outreach efforts and results
- Monitor Domain Rating progress and link quality metrics
- Foster lasting relationships with industry publishers

**Cost & Timeline:**
The cost of Project 6 is $48,400 and is expected to take approximately 12 months to complete.

**Expected Completion Date:**
This project is expected to be completed by January 1, 2026.
